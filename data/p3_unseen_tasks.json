Hemophilia is caused by a lack of clotting factors in the blood. Clotting factors are normally released by platelets.

This is called the adolescent growth spurt . In boys, it is controlled by testosterone. The rate of growth usually starts to increase relatively early in puberty. At its peak rate, growth in height is about 10 centimeters (almost 4 inches) per year in the average male. Growth generally remains rapid for several years.

Immunity can also come about by vaccination. Vaccination is the process of exposing a person to pathogens on purpose so the person will develop immunity to them. In vaccination, the pathogens are usually injected under the skin. Only part of the pathogens are injected, or else weakened or dead pathogens are used.

The climate becomes colder at high elevations\u2014this characteristic is described by the lapse rate of air: air tends to get colder as it rises, since it expands. The dry adiabatic lapse rate is 10 \u00b0C per km (5.5 \u00b0F per 1000 ft) of elevation or altitude. Therefore, moving up 100 metres (330 ft) on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80 kilometers (45 miles or 0.75\u00b0 of latitude) towards the pole.

In addition, you can lower the risk of cancer by avoiding carcinogens , which are substances that cause cancer. For example, you can reduce your risk of lung cancer by not smoking. You can reduce your risk of skin cancer by using sunscreen. How to choose a sunscreen that offers the most protection is explained below ( Figure below ). Some people think that tanning beds are a safe way to get a tan. This is a myth. Tanning beds expose the skin to UV radiation. Any exposure to UV radiation increases the risk of skin cancer.

Fortunately, there are devices such as Geiger counters that can detect radiation. A Geiger counter, like the one pictured in the Figure below , contains atoms of a gas that is ionized if it encounters radiation.

Paul had plenty of time to do his warm up properly, but John got there late and didn't warm up. Paul won the match.Which player was more likely to get injured?\n\nHint: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ).\n.</input>", "target": "<output>John.</output>", "knowledge": "<instruction>\n\nGiven the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: \n\n</instruction>"}, {"sub_task_id": 211, "input": "<input>\nAt a doctor's office, two people come in to get STD tests.

The doctor takes a urine sample from each and will give them the results in a day or two.Would the complications be less severe for Patty or for John if it is found they have chlamydia?\n\nHint: Chlamydia may cause a burning feeling during urination. It may also cause a discharge (leaking of fluids) from the vagina or penis. But in many cases it causes no symptoms. As a result, people do not know they are infected, so they don\u2019t go to the doctor for help. If chlamydia goes untreated, it may cause more serious problems in females. It may cause infections of the uterus, fallopian tubes, or ovaries. These infections may leave a woman unable to have children.\n.</input>", "target": "<output>John.</output>", "knowledge": "<instruction>\n\nGiven the paragraph above, please answer correctly the

The Afghan death toll has been far higher, making the Korengal some of the bloodiest ground in all of Afghanistan, according to American and Afghan officials. \n  \n In the pre-dawn hours of Wednesday, the U.S. presence here came to an abrupt end. \n  \n A day earlier, Capt. Mark Moretti, the 28-year-old commander of American forces in the valley, walked two dozen Korengali elders around his base and told them that the United States was withdrawing. He showed the elders the battle-scarred barracks, a bullet-ridden crane, wheezing generators and a rubber bladder brimming with 6,000 gallons of fuel. \n  \n Moretti, the son of a West Point physics professor, and Shamshir Khan, a valley elder whose son had been jailed for killing two U.S. troops, sat together on a small wall near the base's helicopter pad. In keeping with local custom among friends, they held hands. \n  \n Moretti gently reminded Khan of the deal they had reached a few days earlier: If U.S. troops were allowed to leave peacefully, the Americans wouldn't destroy the base, the crane and the fuel. Khan assured him that the valley's fighters would honor the deal. \n  \n \"I hope that when I am gone, you will do what is best for your valley and the villagers,\" an almost wistful Moretti said. \n  \n \"I want you to travel safely to your home, to your family,\" the 86-year-old elder replied. He gazed at the officer through thick glasses that magnified rheumy brown eyes and beamed. \n  \n Over the previous week, hundreds of U.S. Army Rangers and Afghan commandos had pushed into the valley to control the high ground the enemy would need for a big attack on departing troops.
